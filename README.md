# About the code

 ## &nbsp; The main technologies used to buil our project:
 
   - HTML (basic frame for the webpage)
   - CSS (to take care of the design)
   - Javascript (adding responsiveness and DOM manipulation)
    
# About the project 
  
 ## &nbsp; Some history...
 
  We as a team were randomly grouped together to start a project. Which project?
  Well. That was on us. So we thaught about what connects us...and that was travelling. 
  So all three of us know the issues to find places and events to get intouch with locals or other travellers.
  That's when the idea of mateMe was born and we started to build it from scratch. 
  And here we are. Presenting a decend demo of what is possible on mateMe as it's basic stage. 

 
 ## &nbsp; The team

  Students of the wild code school and this is our first 'upFromScratch'-Project. 
  We struggled a bit on the start and had a little meltdown as a team just in the middle of the project.
  But that's how it is. We are wilders. And we were capable to manage (with a little help of the mentor) and to keep the peace within the team!
